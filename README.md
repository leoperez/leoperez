### Hi there, I'm Leo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a generalist full-stack engineering developer with a knack for **delightful** and **usable UIs**. I love building & documenting design systems, user-centered web apps, cool websites and interactive pieces with React, NodeJs, vanilla JavaScript, [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), Github, Netlify and super optimised CSS!

I have extensive industry experience. From established brands like [Mercedes Benz](https://www.mercedes-benz.es/), [AMEX](https://www.americanexpress.com/) or [Tezos](https://tezos.com/) to tech start-ups like [HeroTraveler](https://herotraveler.com/).

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have many interests and hobbies but, even if I've been building websites for 20+ years, I still get excited with the idea of building a new one, even if it's a small one! I really love the Internet... ðŸ˜‰
